<p> Behind the numbers of GDP and life expectancy lies a human story of opportunity, inequality, and survival. This narrative aims to visualize global disparities in health and wealth to visually show (and not tell) the user that higher-income countries tend to achieve higher life expectancy, while lower-income countries face disparities.  </p>

<h2> Martini Glass Structure </h2>
<h3> Scene 1 – Global Introduction </h3>
<p> Scene 1 corresponds to the wide start (the glass base) of martini glass by showing a linear, global and non-interactive scatterplot overview of Income per Capita along x-axis vs Life Expectancy along y-axis where users are introduced to the entire dataset. It contains each country represented by a bubble sized by population and coloured by continent. This is like a scene setup in filmmaking as the user immediately understands what the data represents at a global level without exploring nor manipulating the visualization. The only control they have is to click "Next" to progress to Scene 2, which is a the first step contrinuing along our linear path.  </p>

<h3> Scene 2 (initial stem and focussed narrative) </h3>
<p> Scene 2 corresponds to the initial stem of the martini glass by narrowing the user's focus and focus to the specific detail around the life expectancy values for low-income countries (which is a subset of the data). This part is still author-driven because the user does not have control over what is being shown at this point with the visualization enforcing attention on disparities in life expectancy in poorer nations. This controlled highlight is a deliberate storytelling choice as it ensures the viewer receives the intended message that poorer nations often have reduced life expectancy, before ththe user even reaches the exploration phase of the narrative.  </p>

<h3> Scene 3 (bowl of glass and exploration) </h3>

<p> Scene 3 corresponds to the bowl of the martini glass where the narrative transitions from the narrow, author-driven path into a reader-driven exploration. At this “jumping off point,” the viewer can choose their own path through the visualization through continent filters and an income level slider. This highlight specific subsets of the data, including geographic regions as well as countries within the threshold of a certain income level per capita. The user decides which subset of data to view. . This exploration encourages the user to pose their own questions, such as "how does life expectancy differ in Asia compared to Europe at similar income levels?" or "What is the distribution of low-income African countries?". During this stage, the user tests hypotheses and discovers insights about global disparities in income and life expectancy that are not directly narrated by the visualisation. The visualization no longer dictates a single narrative flow but instead provides a structured environment where the viewer can pursue their own lines of inquiry within the controlled data space. </p>

<h2> Visual Structure & Scene ordering </h2>
<p> Each scene in the visualization follows a consistent layout template. This entails a scatterplot of Income per Capita along x-axis vs Life Expectancy along y-axis where, with each bubble representing country, the size of this bubble representing the corresponding country's population and represented colour representing continent of corresponding country. Keeping the axes, scales, and layout the same across all scenes prevents the viewer from being distracted by irrelevant visual changes. Instead of reorienting to a new visual setup, the user can focus on the important data insights as relevant new information is revealed, which ensure that the user's focus remains on the intended message about disparities in global health and wealth. </p>

<p> Scene 1 is not only a macro view of global disparities but also the simplest display of scatterplot withotu the "greying out" in scene 2, nor filtering or slider options. Ensuring that the order start with with the simplest visual presentation helps prevent the user from becoming overwhelmed by too much information at once. It allows the viewer to first build familiarity with the data before introducing more complex details and interactions later in the narrative, when they are better prepared to interpret them. </p>

<p> Scene 2 frames the key message explicitly that poorer countries below a certain threshold of income face disparities in life expectancy. Without this framing, in Scene 3 the user may wander aimlessly through filters without understanding what they’re looking for, what patterns to notice nor what questions they should be asking.</p>
