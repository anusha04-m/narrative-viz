<p> Behind the numbers of GDP and life expectancy lies a human story of opportunity, inequality, and survival. This narrative aims to visualize global disparities in health and wealth to visually show (and not tell) the user that higher-income countries tend to achieve higher life expectancy, while lower-income countries face disparities.  </p>

<h2> Martini Glass Structure </h2>
<h3> Scene 1 – Global Introduction </h3>
<p> Scene 1 corresponds to the wide start (the glass base) of martini glass by showing a linear, global and non-interactive scatterplot overview of Income per Capita along x-axis vs Life Expectancy along y-axis where users are introduced to the entire dataset. It contains each country represented by a bubble sized by population and coloured by continent. This is like a scene setup in filmmaking as the user immediately understands what the data represents at a global level without exploring nor manipulating the visualization. The only control they have is to click "Next" to progress to Scene 2, which is a the first step contrinuing along our linear path.  </p>

<h3> Scene 2 (initial stem and focussed narrative) </h3>
<p> Scene 2 corresponds to the initial stem of the martini glass by narrowing the user's focus and focus to the specific detail around the life expectancy values for low-income countries (which is a subset of the data). This part is still author-driven because the user does not have control over what is being shown at this point with the visualization enforcing attention on disparities in life expectancy in poorer nations. This controlled highlight is a deliberate storytelling choice as it ensures the viewer receives the intended message that poorer nations often have reduced life expectancy, before ththe user even reaches the exploration phase of the narrative.  </p>

<h3> Scene 3 (bowl of glass and exploration) </h3>

<p> Scene 3 corresponds to the bowl of the martini glass where the narrative transitions from the narrow, author-driven path into a reader-driven exploration. At this “jumping off point,” the viewer can choose their own path through the visualization through continent filters and an income level slider. This highlight specific subsets of the data, including geographic regions as well as countries within the threshold of a certain income level per capita. The user decides which subset of data to view. . This exploration encourages the user to pose their own questions, such as "how does life expectancy differ in Asia compared to Europe at similar income levels?" or "What is the distribution of low-income African countries?". During this stage, the user tests hypotheses and discovers insights about global disparities in income and life expectancy that are not directly narrated by the visualisation. The visualization no longer dictates a single narrative flow but instead provides a structured environment where the viewer can pursue their own lines of inquiry within the controlled data space. </p>
